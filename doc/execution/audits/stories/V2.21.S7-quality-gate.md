# V2.21.S7 Quality Gate

## Closure contract frozen for V2.21

### Decision A — user-facing command contract
- **Decision:** `tickoni` is the documented product binary for retail users.
- **Required surfaces:** `tickoni --version`, `tickoni doctor`, and the documented demo command path.
- **Non-goal:** `tickoni-supervisor` may remain as an internal/test binary, but it is not the retail-facing trust surface.

### Decision B — CaseOps scope for V2.21
- **Decision:** V2.21 ships CLI, audit, replay, metrics, and diagnostics tier visibility now.
- **Deferred:** CaseOps tier/degraded-guarantee display remains deferred until a dedicated tkapi/UI story lands.
- **Documentation rule:** S7 docs must say this explicitly instead of implying a shipped CaseOps surface.

### Decision C — manual verification format
- **Decision:** V2.21 documents a checksum-based manual verification path.
- **Required evidence:** release artifact filename examples, SHA256 command examples, and the expected local artifact locations.
- **Non-goal:** signed release assets or attestations are not claimed unless they actually exist.

## Acceptance mapping

| S7 acceptance requirement | Owning artifact / command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Support matrix, tiers, install paths, storage, manual verification, update/uninstall, unsupported features | `doc/execution/retail-runtime-support.md` | Canonical closure doc for retail runtime trust surface |
| Tier/degraded-guarantee visibility in CLI/diagnostics and honest CaseOps scope | `tickoni --version`, `tickoni doctor`, `doc/knowledge/platform-tiers.md`, `doc/execution/observability.md` | CaseOps deferred explicitly for V2.21 |
| Paper/sandbox default and live execution disabled | `doc/execution/retail-runtime-support.md`, `doc/execution/V2.21.S7/security-audit.md` | Must be visible in user-facing docs |
| Privacy defaults / no installer telemetry by default | `doc/execution/telemetry.md`, `doc/execution/retail-runtime-support.md`, `doc/execution/V2.21.S7/telemetry-audit.md` | Opt-in diagnostics only by future explicit decision |
| Evidence artifacts linked | `doc/execution/V2.21.S7/evidence-index.md` | Must link version, doctor, demo, blocked-flow, conformance, audit, replay |

## Deferred from V2.21

- CaseOps dashboard/UI display of runtime tier and degraded guarantees
- Release-signing/attestation claims beyond checksum-based verification
- Windows-specific closure work owned by V2.22
- Any claim of Linux full-runtime parity on macOS retail runtime

## Review checklist

- [x] Command contract chosen
- [x] CaseOps scope chosen
- [x] Manual verification format chosen
- [x] Every S7 acceptance criterion mapped to an artifact or command
- [x] Deferred work stated explicitly to prevent silent scope creep into V2.22 or future UI work
